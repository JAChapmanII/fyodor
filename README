Fyodor is a program that answers text based questions. It is currently in extreme alhpa, and the
code base is not stable. It is not recommended to download or even hack fyodor right now.

The git repo is a mess, because I've been (not) learning git this whole time. That's why all the
work has been done in the master branch.

The code is a mess because I've been using this as a project to learn to shell script.

Building:

Set up the config file. Change the SRCROOT variable to point to the folder holding this file. Change
the USERNAME variable if you want fyodor to run as a user other than "fyodor"
Create a user that is the same name as USERNAME. Put it only in the users group to aviod potential
security holes.

Run install with root priveleges.
Login as the new user and run ./fetchmail and ./fyodor

Using:

Text "help" to your fyodor's email address.
