Fyodor is a program that answers text based questions. It is currently in extreme alhpa, and the
code base is not stable. It is not recommended to download or even hack fyodor right now.

The git repo is a mess, because I've been (not) learning git this whole time. That's why all the
work has been done in the master branch.

The code is a mess because I've been using this as a project to learn to shell script.

Building:

Set up the config file. Start with
	mv config{.example,}
Then, change the email username and password to be an actual gmail user/pass. I suggest you create
account just for this. [Especially since GMail could shut it down at any time ;)] Change the SRCROOT
variable to point to the folder holding this file. Change the USERNAME variable if you want fyodor
to run as a user other than "fyodor". Read the comments for further instructions.
Create a user that is the same name as USERNAME. Put it only in the users group to avoid potential
security holes.
	useradd -g users ${USERNAME} # as root
Make sure it's default shell is either bash unless you want to create a .${SHELL}rc
for it. One way around this is to set it to use your shell, and then add your config file to the
COPYFILES variable in config.

Run install with root privileges.
Login as the new user and run ./fetchmail and ./fyodor

Using:

Text "help" to your fyodor's email address.

Dependencies:

Whoo, boy, let's see... bash, zsh, sed, offlineimap, tar, push/popd (separate?), msmtp, pgrep,
	grep, tr, base64, lynx, links (TODO), wget, egrep, convert, cowsay, and core utils, sudo
