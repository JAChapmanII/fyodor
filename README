Fyodor is a program that answers text based questions. It is currently in
extreme alhpa, and the code base is not stable. It is not recommended to
download or even hack fyodor right now.

The git repo is a mess, because I've been (not) learning git this whole time.
That's why all the work has been done in the master branch.

The code is a mess because I've been using this as a project to learn to shell
script. [And because after long absences I try to re-make sense of it all and
start adding in a bunch of more stuff]


Building:

Set up the config file. Start with mv config{.example,}
Change the ROOT_DIR variable to point to the folder holding this file.
	This is important, the $(whoami) code fails for sure, unless you do
	everything as root!
Change the USERNAME variable if you want fyodor to run as a user other than
the default, "fyodor".
	Do NOT use your own username for this, it will completely crash everything ;)
Read the comments for further instructions.

Create a user that is the same name as USERNAME.
	Put it only in the users group to avoid potential security holes.
	useradd -g users ${USERNAME} # as root should do it
You may want to either create a .${SHELL}rc and put it in the fyodor folder to
be copied over, or tell it to use yours by adding it to the COPY_FILES array in
the config
Something else that may save you some headache is to use the /etc/limits.conf
file to limit the number of processes fyoodor may use. 

Run install with root privileges.
		sudo ./install
	[If you don't have sudo, I assume you know how to work it ;)]

	Yes, I barely trust this damn thing even not to fsck my system. Please,
	inspect the code and prepare for a potential dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda . I
	I will try to get this a bit more OK in the future, hopefully through the
	use of at least some daemonization and a proper installation. It is slated
	for ASAP. [I typed that over a year ago, I'd say. Good luck with it.]

Login as the new user and run ./fyodor
	[It will sit there and use up a terminal, so I recommend a terminal
	multiplexer such as tmux. Most of the output won't be what you want anyway]

If there are any problems (I'm sure there will be, don't worry) try to figure
them out :p
	If you can, it'd be a great help to me if you could email me either your
	problem/solution or even a patch.
	If you can't, then email me or something. Send me as much output from stuff
	as you can. I can't remember if there are any verbose switches or not, but
	try some combinations of things that you think might make output verbose :)


Using:

Text "help" to your fyodor's email address.
Email "help" to your fyodor's email address.
And, coming soon: run fyodor from any terminal!
[peh, "soon" lol]

Dependencies:

Whoo, boy, let's see...
	bash
	sed
	tar
	grep
	tr
	base64
	lynx, links (TODO)
	wget
	core utils

	If you want to use the cowsay module, these are needed:
		convert, cowsay
	I think you need convert for the japanese function too. These will try to
	fail gracefully, with a message, if the needed programs are not installed.

A major todo is to shorten this up, reuse things that can be reused for multiple
dependencies, and modularize it so that you know you only need cowsay for the
cow function of fyodor.
