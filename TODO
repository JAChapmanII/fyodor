fix non undoing of password/user sed'ing in files on crash during install
on change back at end do something with sed and passwords with / [ ] etc in them
on new install Mail/GMail/INBOX/new needs made
	Mail/home/fyodor/Mail/GMail/INBOX is made?
Maildir creatin is fscked up
Ensure password and username are put in there properly, it causes major problems
otherwise
Check for offlineimap/msmtp
Check for any dependencies instead of a bunch of fail

Handle back log of requests more sanely than sending out 70 SMS/MMS messages in
2 minutes, maybe an exponential delay when there is a queue, one for each
recipient or something like that. Also, maybe we should report fails, but only
in the event that 90 messages aren't already queued to that person ;)
